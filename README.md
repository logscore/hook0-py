# Hook0 Python SDK (Example by Borea.dev)

This is a sample Python SDK developed by Borea.dev for Hook0. It demonstrates how developers can easily integrate with the Hook0 API to send and manage webhook-based events in Python applications.
Overview

The SDK provides a clean and minimal interface for the Hook0 API. It's designed to showcase how Hook0 can be used in Python environments with straightforward and developer-friendly code.
## Features

- Easy setup and configuration

- Simple interface to interact with Hook0's endpoints

- Lightweight and extensible

- Built with clarity in mind for fast onboarding

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/logscore/hook0-py.git
cd hook0-py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Getting Started

Check out the included working example in sdk_example.py. It walks through the basic usage of the SDK and demonstrates how to:

1. Initialize the client

2. Create a event type

3. Send a test event
4. Create a new subscription
5. Sned an event through to that subscription

Notes

This SDK is a demonstration of what Borea can do and may not be ready for production use. We do not default handle OAuth, webhooks, SSE, low level logic or websockets, yet. Its purpose is to serve as a foundation for building a fully-featured SDK in collaboration with the Hook0 team.
